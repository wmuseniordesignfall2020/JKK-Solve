### Github
We will use github as our primary Version Control System
1. As best we can we will try to keep our core in a consistent format among folders.
2. Ensure all tests pass before pushing any code
3. Communicate Our Changes Before Pushing and Major Code Changes Will Be Discussed First
4. Update Bugs & Issues as We Come Across Them
