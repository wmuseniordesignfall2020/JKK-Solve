//Instructions for Installation / Build

The quad solver will be put into a .tar file for which will be downloaded by the client. This file will then be 
extracted using an extract function when right clicking on the file. Once this is done, this can be opened by 
any IDE or interface with the capabilities of running C code. It could also be opened in the terminal where the 
program will run natively. The program can be compiled using various make functions 
(“make help” - for the entire list of make functions) or simply just “make”. The user can then run the program 
as many times as needed. 

STEP BY STEP:

1. Download the .tar file containing the quad solver
2. Extract the file into your directory
3. In the Linix Terminal (Ubuntu respectively), navigate to the folder, JKK-Solve -> src.
3.5. [If you want to run this in test mode, navigate to only the JKK-Solve directory and type 'make help' for details]
4. Once in src, you may run the 'make' function to compile the code.
5. Then you are free to type 'make run' or ./qsolve_roots to run the program.
